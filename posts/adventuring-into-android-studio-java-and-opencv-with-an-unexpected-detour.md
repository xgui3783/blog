Following on from the previous weekâ€™s progress, this week, we are trying to make progress towards OpenCV to be used on an android platform. I have encountered problem of course.

Firstly, there was the issue of Android Studio not recognising hardware.camera, and threw me a number of errors. Turns out, I needed to update the target SDK across different build.gradle files.

More significantly, I was thrown the error that the app could not have access to the camera.

Digging for an answer online, they seem to suggest that I needed to declare the permission to use camera in android manifest (which I did), and check if other apps are using the camera (they are not, since the native camera app works fine). And very coincidentally, when the emulator told me that I had not enough (virtual) space, and when I am trying to uninstall some early iterations of the app, did I notice that I had to manually give the app permission to use the camera.

And suddenly, it works!

Next step, messing with the Mat variables so that it can recognise border symbol.

Next next step, free transform the image and integrate osra + openbabel and output mol file

final step, 3d rendering of the mol file in opengl.

And suddenly, an interruption. I was asked to modify a resource management that I created long ago with html/css/js/jquery/php/mysql. It was clear what the client wanted. I have a good idea of how I would proceed. But this meant I will need to put the android opencv project to a halt. That being said, it is a good time to give the webapp a facelift. Although it did what it supposedly did, it has a face only its mother (me) would love.
