As the previous day, all talks I attended are in chronological order. The only difference is, I tried to attend everything remotely... in my hotel room... about 1km away from the venue.

Also, the event happened on 2024-02-04, so this post is a latergram.

There will be a third post in this series, in which I will talk about my experience.

## Testing & CD: Streamline DX

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2964-streamlining-developer-experience-the-power-of-ci-cd-standardization-and-interoperability/)

It might seem obvious, but standardization of CI/CD and docs improves onboarding.

## Doc maintenance

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2523-mind-the-gap-building-a-cultural-commitment-to-documentation-maintenance/)

Linting the doc. Check when the code is updated, to ensure that the doc is also updated. 

Being responsive to first time contributors. 

Veil Lint (???) 

## Lazy developer

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2231-a-lazy-developer-s-approach-to-building-real-time-web-applications/)

Interesting demo of public karaoke. Also learnt about [CNCF: NATS](https://www.cncf.io/projects/nats/).

## Phabricator

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3610-unpack-phabricator-welcome-phorge-forking-the-opinionated-open-source-project-manager/)

An interesting approach to source code version management. Issues are not bound to projects, but all pooled together. They are categorised by labels. This is something I can get behind, honestly. 

It also supports mercurial, svn, in addition to git. 

It's php based, and he's not joking about [gitlab taking inspiration from phabricator](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/08/13/five-great-phabricator-features-inspired-gitlab/)

## Observability common schema

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1734-unifying-observability-the-power-of-a-common-schema/)

Since I am quite new to the whole observability, metrics, monitoring world, I was only briefly aware of the competing standards. My understanding is that, opentelemetry is the effort to create a common standard. To accomplish this goal, it is likely that some conventions may need to be deprecated.

Another remark, OTLP (open telemetry language protocol ?), describes `resource` and `LogRecord` (or as I understand, payload), is very reminiscent on how k8s organise resources.

## Owncloud infinite scale

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2415-how-to-build-an-open-source-school-cloud-for-5-million-users/)

Provide cloud storage & cloud office solution to all secondary students in Germany. Uneven load is definiitely going to be an issue (e.g. at 8am CET, server load will spike, but overnight, load will be little/none)

I have also learnt the difference between owncloud 10 (single installation) and owncloud infinite scale (cloud native) (I think?)

## So you think you know git

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3611-so-you-think-you-know-git/)

Easily the most entertaining, and most educational talk of the day (or the entire event). A list of thing I learnt:

```sh 
- git blame/git log \
    -L start:end path/to/file.txt \
    -w [ignore whitespace] \
    -C [detect movement] -C -C
- git diff --word-diff
- git rerere.enabled - remembers how conflict resolution
- git branch --column --sort
- git push --force-with-lease
- commit with ssh
- git maintenance start
- git sparse-checkout
- (github) git ls-remote, PRs are refs
```

## Closing session

[abstract](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3024-closing-fosdem-2024/)

Also learnt a lot in this session regarding the technical challenges associated with running a conference with multiple tracks, all need their own video streaming, in particular:

- the ease of operating the system (since technical volunteers needs to be trained with least amount of effort)
- upload throughput (lots of parallel uploads)
- monitoring of potential issues (audio? visual?)
- plan B's (blackout? slides/ not working etc)
- setup & tear down
