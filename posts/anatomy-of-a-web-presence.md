I have had to explain to a few clients about the process of constructing a web site. And so I thought, it is probably worthwhile compiling a TL,DR version, to which I could point future clients.

Additionally, I having liberally included some existing products, which I have used in the past and could vouch for their quality. However, this is NOT a sponsored content. I simply would like my clients to know all of the alternatives as well as the various aspects of web design, and the cost they can expect.

### 1\. Domain + Hosting (Must)

This is where you buy the real estate of your online space.

I found hover (domain) and zuver (domain + hosting) to be the most user friendly, without a premium price tag. Do your research before plunging in. If in doubt, ask your designer for advice.

*   Domain (e.g. www.yourbusiness.com) is like your electronic address (yes, you have to buy your address separately for your website)
*   Hosting is like the electronic plot of land, where you can build your electronic shop front

### 2\. Design (Must)

This is where webdesigners can build on the real estate you purchased. Which shape? Which colour? So many choices!

#### 2.1 Logo + Layout + Colour

Some web designers can help you decide on a logo, if you do not already have one.

The logo will likely determine the major and minor colours of your website.

Unless you have **very specific** need in terms of layout and functionality of your website, your web designers will likely use one of the CMS (Content management systems) such as wordpress, drupal or joomla to build your virtual real estate.

#### 2.2 Photos and graphics

Relevant photos and graphics can make your website pop out from the rest. You can either commission a photographer or a graphic designer to shoot/custom design your ideal photographs and/or graphics, or pay for stock images/graphics.

#### 2.3 Content

There are two different types of content that are relevant to a website: static and dynamic. **Static content** are the information that does not change very often. For example, your team bio, your company’s mission statement, address, contact info, etc. **Dynamic content** are the information that changes frequently, such as blog posts (see below) or social media interactions.

There is little or no outsourcing of this part. In order to accurately depict your company and your value, you will need to sit down and follow your designer’s request and provide contents such as company profile and team bios. You could get an intern to do it, if you are too busy. Dynamic content, are optional (see below), but probably can be drafted by an intern and edited by middle management.

### 3\. SEO + social media (Optional, but helpful)

Search engine optimisation (SEO) and interacting with (potential) customers on social media are the two bottomless void. One can easily sink huge sum of money and time into perfecting these two hungry beasts. I will only briefly talk about what you can expect.

#### 3.1 Social Media Presence

*   Frequent posts to social media accounts.
*   Keep relevant posts : irrelevant posts ratio high  
    However, some filler posts can humanise your business. After all, saying hello is a human nature.
*   Provide timely response to customers’ enquiries

#### 3.2 SEO (the basics)

*   Submit links to search engines (such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc).
*   Mobile friendly site
*   Well maintained blog  
    Frequently updated with relevant information. Having external sites link to your blog content is a huge bonus.
*   Sitemap available
*   Physical contact information  
    Address, phone numbers etc.
*   No dead links
