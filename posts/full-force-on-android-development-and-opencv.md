Now that the other projects have came to a natural pause and/or end, I was finally able to get into the AR app for molecular visualisation. The idea is nothing new, I believe. But I don’t think anyone’s done it (yet)? Or at least I hope no one had done it yet. I wonder why?

First step is to get myself familiarised again with Android development environment. It has been a while since I touched Java Development Environment (Eclipse was the program I used in the past). Some (most) came back, at least the XML part of it. I am certainly going to hope that the Java part will come back very soon, too.

I am going to suspect when I start to get myself accustomed with openCV, is where learning curve will start to look like a vertical asymptote. I have looked at a few guides on youtube. Am I going to hell, if I said the accent on one of the video guide cracked me up a little bit? No evil intention, of course.

`Cannot resolve the symbol R`? Are you Kidding me, number five? Who do you think I am you are?  
Turns out, I was an idiot. The aforementioned error usually will not stop the compilation. I mistyped `onClick` as `onclick` and `theOnlyTextView` as `theOnlyTextview`.
