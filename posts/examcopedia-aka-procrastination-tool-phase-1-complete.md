Today, 24th May 2016, marks an important day. I have completed the first phase of examcopedia. I agree, I am pretty bad at naming things. I have finished the submission and viewing interface. All thatâ€™s to do is just fleshing things out, and the painful, painful process of entering thousands of questions.

Rather annoyingly, Openshift seems to impose [some sort of limitations on fs module in node.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19982839/nodejs-fs-module-does-not-work-in-openshift). I understand fs.exists() is deprecated, but fs.access() yielded me with a similar error. I will attempt fs.stat(), but I am not optimistic.

Major progress so far. I fs.stat() works. Also, in the mean time, I was able to get the mobile upload to work, too. I was able to get HTML5 `<input type = "file" accept = "image/*;capture=camera">` in order to allow users to upload their photos from capturing from the camera or their local device.

I was also able to make some major breakthroughs. Namely, I found that for node.js v1.4.5, in order to find the list of clients in a specific room, you use `io.sockets.adapter.rooms[roomname]`. Returns undefined if no-one is in the room.
