WIP thoughts on first timers

- read [survive fosdem](https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2019/10/15/how-to-survive-fosdem/) . it.... is very useful
- most importantly, bring water, bring snack
- if there is a talk you *definitely* want to go to, go early (preferably before the *entire* session starts. So you get some seats)
- normalize retiring early (don't need to see everything, just enjoying yourself)

Sessions I went to:

- Open Research - Gephi Lite
- JS: Profiling JS
    - shallow size
    - deep size
    - facebook/memlab (more indepth memory usage profiler)
    - clinic js
- JS: Brownfield -> Greenfield
    - tightly couple -> loosely couple (interfaces)
- JS: Eventloop
    - callback -> not always better. CPU intensive tasks can still be blocking. 
    - use worker thread
    - IO bound tasks still fine
- Open Research - French open science monitor
    - unpaywall.org (blurb from nature... how ... ironic?)
    - grobid: tool to extract metadata from pdf
    - coki (curtin open knowledge initiative)
    - openalex
    - hal.science
- Open Research: RDM PHAIDRA
- Open Research: Frictionless data
