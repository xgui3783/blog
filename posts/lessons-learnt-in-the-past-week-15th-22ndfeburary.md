One of the clients wanted his site to be remade.

His existing site was wildly outdated, as it was put together hastely. At the time, I was not sure if he wanted a new site or not. But he pays me, I thought I should look out for him, so I whipped up something very simple.

But now, he has a clearer picture of how he wanted the website. He wanted it to be responsive, and probably incorporates a few more slide show images. I figured I might as well make it on wordpress for a faster turn-around. This is when I noticed, except for Zerif-Lite, the customisability of most of the themes are wildly underwhelming. Or perhaps, it’s just I have much more to learn about wordpress.

If anyone can tell me what is the equivalent of modules in wordpress, especially on the front page, I’d be eternally grateful. Or is it that I have to hard code everything on a static front page?

More worryingly, there is one or two themes, where I could not see one of the modules (fullscreen image, in bootstrap, .jumbotron), let alone customise it. Perhaps I should try to use Drupal and that would be more of my liking?

Shout out to the good guys/gals who made [Zerif-Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/). It is my first venture into the world of wordpress (was using Joomla and then Notepad before that). The amount of features available is incredible. And I almost feel bad bypassing the pay wall by renaming the section id’s. Kudos to them for not tying in CSS format with section id’s.

It seems like plugins are the closest thing to modules in WordPress. I should delve into it sometime. For now, a selection of my photography life can be seen at [here](http://www.pandamakes.com.au/about). (That was a shameless plug.)

I have had a nice dinner with a couple of good friends of mine. It seems both of them have ideas to get away from their current jobs and start something exciting.

Whilst I promised myself I will wait until the arrival of the new laptop before I would start on the Android project, I cannot help but to read up on what needs to be done. I figured I will need _OpenCV_ to recognise the optical trigger, then hopefully, do a free transform to turn the optical information to an image. Then, use _OSRA_ to turn the image into a SMILES or hopefully, directly into a MOL. If the latter cannot happen, I will need _openBabel_ to convert the SMILES into MOL. What I did not realise was MOL is already 3D capable, with x, y and z axis. The rest should be just _openGL_ to render the 3D graphics.
