**Background:**

I started this blog as a way for me to record my transition from my previous day-job, to one that is more intimately related to web development and programming. I believed (and I still do believe) that these records will be the testament that can attest for my conviction can experience. If I am lucky enough, I may even use the contents of this blog as a proof of character, showing potential clients and/or employers what I am capable of. As a result, I have been trying to ensure that the blog is as free of personal entries as possible.

However, it may no longer be possible, as I will explain.

**The tectonic change:**

As I have given hints in the previous posts, change has come for me. I have accepted a front-end developer position, situated in Germany. I have been busy for the past month (April â€™17), preparing for the move to the other side of the world. My position officially start on 1st May (well, 2nd of May, since 1st May is a public holiday).

**What is becoming of this blog?**

I do not intend to poison this blog with my personal struggles and triumphs in Germany. I will hopefully update this blog with the same frequency I have done in the past. However, this will likely depend largely on what I can/cannot talk about, the kind of issues I will be dealing with, and the amount of free time I can expect to get.

My thoughts are rather tangled right now. Lots of uncertainty and anxiety.

Apologies for the lack of tech in this post.
