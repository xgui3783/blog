I use [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) as a templating tool in NodeJS applications. The syntax and usage reminds me much of php. Of course, EJS is a very different beast. One down side, however, is that there are no recognisable plugin in Notepad++ that recognises EJS. For a while, I endured and used javascript formatting, but life is getting harder without the ability to see nesting hierarchy. So I configured something that works (for the most part).

This is by no means perfect. For example, it only tries to nest `<div>` elements. But for my purpose, this is enough. My livelihood does not depend on writing notepad++ plugins after all.
