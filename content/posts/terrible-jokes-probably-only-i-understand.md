Here’s an easy one:

NaCl = Native Client.  
so salty.

Here’s more like a self-deprecating joke:When downloading an example, instead of clicking the “download” button like a normal, sane person, you try to find the `git clone` command.

Here is maybe one more:when creating a new file, my first mode of action is to go to terminal, `cd` into the directory and `touch FILENAME`.  
similarly, looking at the directory, it is becoming more natural to use `ls -l` rather than `dir`

Real talk now. I am about to embark on a new journey. A new part of my life. I’d be lying if I say I am not scared. Scared of the unknown. Scared of not being good enough. Do I have impostor syndrome? Or do I lack the expertise to do my job well, as I have long suspected?Well, no turning back now. Impostor syndrome or not, I’m going to dive in head first, into the dimly lit unknown. It might be concrete and my head will end up in pieces. It might be calm, warm tropical sea. It might only be a swimming pool.
