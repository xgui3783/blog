Awhile ago, my `curl` suddenly stopped working, citing:

```bash
unable to get local issuer certificate
```

After a bit of digging, it seems that `openssl` cannot accurately resolve some ssl certificates (especially, perhaps exclusively let's encrypt certs).

I on-and-off tried to resolve the issue, but didn't realise the issue is easily resolved with 

```bash
sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh
```
