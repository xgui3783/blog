A client recently bought a domain and hosting from GoDaddy. I have heard some horrid stories from web go’ers. I guess I will experience first hand the pain?

First problem, the wp-admin hangs indefinitely.

Hmm… I am having trouble with cPanel at Zuver, too. Perhaps it’s the USB network share?

Turns out, it takes a while for the DNS setting to propagate. However, even after a day, Zuver is **significantly** faster than godaddy. I think I found the hover of hosting.
