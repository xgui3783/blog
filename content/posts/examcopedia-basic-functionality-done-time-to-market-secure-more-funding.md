The basic functionality of examcopedia has been refined in the past few weeks. Now, it is at a presentable state. Next step is to promote the site and/or secure some funding to further develop it.

I am thinking of writing to some parties which may have direct or indirect interest in seeing examcopedia grow. In the local scope, ATA, teacherâ€™s health fund, in the global scope, google edu, microsoft.

I have doubts. I am scared. Of the possibilities of failure. I am scared that I might not be good enough. I am scared that examcopedia might not be good enough. Even though I truly believe its potential. We should write in.

I came across [this article](http://andrewkelley.me/post/do-not-use-bodyparser-with-express-js.html) whilst researching on bodyparser (which I believe is required for passport).

I believe the issue had been resolved, as bodyparser no longer parsers multipart post requests.

In the past week, I have had some success at trying to connect to potential stake holders. I realised that I needed to broaden my scope a little, or alternatively, pitch in a very different direction if I want to gain any success in the near future. I need to work on the pitch a lot better. I need to be able to deliver a good pitch even if I was drunk/hungover/very very tired. I was talking to my friend about what I was trying to do, and I sounded like Peter Russo at the end of House of Cards S1.

Very quickly, fixed some small problems with timetabling. Almost allowed JS injection exploit.
