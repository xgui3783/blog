I read the news on Amazon Inspire last night (27/06/16, 1300 AEST), in bed [from tech crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/27/amazon-jumps-into-online-learning-with-inspire-a-platform-for-free-crowdsourced-and-premium-materials/). My heart sank. On the one hand, I am over joyed that I have the vision to target the still under competed education market. On the other hand, I feel an unease, a sense of doom. There is no way I can compete against a tech giant like amazon. Yet, I feel a sense of excitement. I have worked in the front line. I know exactly what kind of software would work with me.

One thing is for sure. Either seize the bull by its horn now, or give it up and cut my losses.

The irony is, examcopedia is currently hosted on openshift, which uses aws as the infrastructure.
