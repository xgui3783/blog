In the same [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEfDMjogJnw) by [anthony](https://www.youtube.com/@anthonywritescode), I learnt of `git log --before/--until=<date>`. Man page reads:

```sh
       --until=<date>, --before=<date>
           Show commits older than a specific date.
```

How is it that I only learn about this just now =/.
