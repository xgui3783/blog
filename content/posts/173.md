As I was working on node.js application over the past weeks or so, I came across [this post](http://blog.ragingflame.co.za/2015/2/6/resizing-images-in-nodejs-applications#comment-1862989718). In it, a commentor described how customised user inputs can potentially inject harmful codes. As a part of my current project utilises base64 encoded image blobs, I wonder if code injection can occur?

It seems openshift has imagemagick installed by default. A simple `convert --version` executed from ssh showed me. I have installed gm and imagemagick on my localmachine. The aim is to resize, rotate, and using high contrast to modify the images (particular the mobile uploaded oneâ€™s).
