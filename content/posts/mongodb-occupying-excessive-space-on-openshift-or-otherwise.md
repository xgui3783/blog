I was doing some daily maintenance on one of the clientâ€™s web service. the site was incredibly slow. Everything else is as fast as money vanishing in my bank account, what could be the cause? I decided to investigate. I thought I would first investigate the amount of space left on the app (which is deployed on Openshift).

Goodness gracious. After 65 mb. The culprit must be elsewhere. So I delved into world wide web, hoping to find an answer. And an answer I found.

According to the author of [this blog post](http://www.overtakenbyevents.com/openshift-mongodb-out-of-diskspace/), mongodb allocates some space for journaling, in the event that write to DB fails. Doing what he did, I found:

Bingo. If I can help it, I would like to keep the journaling of mongodb. Meanwhile, I will monitor the usage weekly. If the space runs out too quickly, I will do what is necessary.
